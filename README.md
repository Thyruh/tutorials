std::cout << "Hello, disciples!\n";

The very basics of the C++ programming language.

The repository includes syntax 101 for those migrating from other languages (Whatever your problem is, i would never change any current language to cpp, but I don't have a choice anymore...)

This also could be used by absolute beginners, featuring (very high-level) explanations to what integer, char*, std::string, and many other objects are. In case you are undecided as a beginner if you actually want to study C++, please, switch to Golang, or even to Python, you still have time.

For those who stayed to suffer, just go over the .cpp (.cc) files, they contain an overly obsessive amount of comments to make sureyou are left with no
questions. For reference, even your college professor in a coding class won't make you write that many comments. If you have any questions, please refer
to a thing called A search engine, or in case you really want to use AI: thyruh.business@gmail.com is the gmail that i just created for the very purpose
of not using AI. I may check it once or twice a year, just like any group chat with 5+ people in it (Especially in messenger, jeez, the app sucks balls) // Can I be sued for saying this? We will find out I guess

I am getting off topic...

Lets set some ground rules. What that means is I will outline the best use of this source for you:
   1. Do not treat this as documentation of any kind. It should be more of a 30 day challenge for you, go through the files, understand them, and forget
   about this repo. In case you do need an actual reference of how things should be done outside of basics provided in this document, here is couple of
   links to cpp documentation:
      - https://cppreference.com    (Doesn't seem to be up at the time of typing this out, but i do recommend this website)
      - https://cplusplus.com/doc
      - https://devdocs.io/cpp/     (Never personally used this one, but seems quite professional (as in the frontend looks horrible, which usually
      signifies actual knowledge of whoever maintains the platform), so check it out)

   2. I will not go over any installation for two simple reasons. I, an any shape, way, or form don't want to be responsible for corrupting the youth by
   recommending them VS C*de or even worse - VS. This is how people go the bad route, drugs, clubs, prostitutes and other quick dopamine sources. Sorry,
   we are talking about coding, not irl stuff (pun intended), so the closest thing to being a hard drug addict in our field is doing JavaScript in the
   backend. Which is what will happen to any young and impressionate person using M*crosoft products.    But the problem is alternatives, especially for
   languages like cplusplus are lacking. I don't want all inexperienced developers to start with Vim or Emacs, the learning curve will absolutely
   decimate beginners.

   3. idk, think of something smart and just pull request it (This applies to both .cpp files, and this README).

License: idgaf, you can do whatever the hell you want, but if you cloned the repo and happened to make some usefull changes, please consider a little git push;
