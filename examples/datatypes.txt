Yeah, no point for a .cc file here, i think.

Before I begin. There will not be anything about the C/C++ syntax (Other than complaints, and constant expressions of how much
i dislike the C++ syntax)
I assume you have already gone through that part of the repo, as README suggests.

So, types...

For now we will talk about a couple of basic ones such as:
    - integer.
    - string. (or std::string, speaking of poor decisions:)
    - boolean.
    - char/char*.
    - std::array.
    - And of course std::vector (That is a joke, but fasten your seatbelts, ladies and gentlemen, we will get there BLAZINGLY FAST)

In C/C++ an average code snippet for an integer usage would be this:

int main() {
    return 0;
}

Now you are going to ask: "What???? How is that an example of an integer when there are no varibles?"
Well, an integer doesn't automatically imply a varible, in this case we have an example of a constant expression with a type int.
Which is used by the program, just not stored as an integer on the g++ compiler level. But this is a bit of stretch. From now on,
we will refer to this type of integer as an integer-literal, or just literal.


Now something more logical would be:

```

int main() {
    int x = 0;
    return x;
}

```
